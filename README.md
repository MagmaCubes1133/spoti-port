# spoti-port
Made this cause i was sick of having my massive library of songs locked to spotify. Would love to export a list f my liked songs, playlists, etc and port it all to othe rplatforms like YT music, or make some auto downloader script to get mp3, FLAC, etc audio files. TL;DR, making your music library portable across platforms again
